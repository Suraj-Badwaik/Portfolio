          <div>
            <p>
              This is a functional clone of the sephora website. The pages that
              we tried to include here are the home page, the cart and checkout
              process pages, the login and signup pages, and all the navbar
              pages (the top black navbar). The brands page displays letters on
              the top and on clicking a letter, the page scrolls to the brands
              starting from that letter. For all the other pages, the displayed
              products on the pages can be added to cart, and it displays the
              total price, and allows you to place the order. The page also has
              a custom icon in the tab that we added.
